## The Power of Capabilities

Each capability:
1. **Encapsulates weeks of work** - Error handling, edge cases, scaling
2. **One-click setup** - Just add API keys
3. **Production-ready** - Not prototypes, but battle-tested patterns
4. **Original apps** - Combine capabilities in unique ways

## For L1_ORCH:

When users describe innovative apps, think:
- What sophisticated capabilities do they need?
- How much time does each capability save?
- What's the simplest integration path?

The goal: Enable apps that would normally require a team of engineers to build!
