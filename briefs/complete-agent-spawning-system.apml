task: Complete Agent Spawning Infrastructure
priority: high
context:
  issue: "Agent spawning system partially built but not fully functional"
  current_state:
    - agent-worker.js exists but only simulates work
    - Server can spawn processes but agents don't use real Claude instances
    - No connection between agent specialists and their system prompts
    
requirements:
  - Connect agent-worker.js to actual Claude API (via MCP or direct)
  - Pass system prompts from capability library to spawned agents
  - Implement real work execution, not simulation
  - Ensure agents can write actual code to VFS
  - Add agent lifecycle management (start, monitor, stop)
  
architecture_notes:
  - Each agent should be a separate process
  - Agents need their specialist system prompt on spawn
  - Agents communicate via WebSocket to ADE server
  - VFS writes should show correct agent attribution
  
deliverables:
  - Updated agent-worker.js with real implementation
  - Agent spawning that creates actual Claude instances
  - Test showing multiple agents working in parallel
  - VFS files attributed to correct agents (not L1_ORCH)
