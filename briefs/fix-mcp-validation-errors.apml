task: Fix MCP L1_ORCH Server Validation Errors
priority: urgent
context:
  issue: "Claude Desktop showing Zod validation errors when connecting to MCP server"
  symptoms:
    - "invalid_union" errors on id fields
    - "invalid_type" expecting string/number but receiving undefined
    - "unrecognized_keys" errors
  current_file: /Users/tomcassidy/claude-code-experiments/APML-Projects/ADE/multi-agent-system/mcp-l1-orch.js
  
requirements:
  - Ensure all JSON-RPC responses have proper id field (never null/undefined)
  - Fix response format to match MCP protocol expectations
  - Handle edge cases where request might not have id
  - Validate all tool responses return correct format
  - Test with actual Claude Desktop connection
  
technical_notes:
  - MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
  - Response must have either 'result' or 'error', never both
  - Tool responses need specific content structure
  
deliverables:
  - Fixed mcp-l1-orch.js 
  - No validation errors in Claude Desktop
  - All tools (get_messages, send_apml, get_status) working
